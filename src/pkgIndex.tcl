## What's that

The *alited* stands for "a lite editor".

The main features of *alited* are:

  * structured code
  * easy access to the code
  * born for [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) development only

It satisfies most requirements of [Tcl Editors](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/Tcl+Editors), adding its own features.

Edited by *alited* are [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) files. The C/C++ code is another target of *alited*, still for *[Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) development only* all the same.

The *alited* facilitates the development and the maintenance of [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code, particularly because of the [unit tree](https://aplsimple.github.io/en/tcl/alited/index.html#units) being a sort of documentation.

The *alited* is suspected of being very good with large [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) projects, i.e. when, in one session, you deal with 30-40-50... [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) scripts, to say nothing of others.

It's quick at starting.

It's quick at switching projects.

It's quick at organizing [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at navigating [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at searching [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at writing [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at testing [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at saving [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at maintaining [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

Briefly, *alited* is totally quick, being at that *a pure [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) application.*

For a quick acquaintance of *alited*, a few of demo videos are available:

## Inevitable blah-blah

The *alited* project started 1 March 2021.

In fact, *alited* has been developed by its own v0.2 since 24 April 2021. Inspite of permanent overheads of this way, it turned out to be amazingly productive, more and more in the course of time.

Below is a screenshot of *alited*, just to glance at it:

... and its localized and themed variant:
