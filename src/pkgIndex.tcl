  # A short intro (for Ruff! docs generator:)

  variable _ruff_preamble {
The *alited* stands for "a lite editor".

The main features of *alited* are:

  * structured code 
  * easy access to the code
  * born for [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) development only

It satisfies most requirements of [Tcl Editors](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/Tcl+Editors), adding its own features.

Edited by *alited* are [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) files. The C/C++ code is another target of *alited*, still for *[Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) development only* all the same.

The *alited* facilitates the development and the maintenance of [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code, particularly because of the [unit tree](https://github.com/aplsimple/alited/releases/download/2.Units_alited-1.0.5/2.Units_alited-1.0.5.mp4) being a sort of documentation.

The *alited* is suspected of being very good with large [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) projects, i.e. when, in one session, you deal with 30-40-50... [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) scripts, to say nothing of others.

It's quick at starting.

It's quick at switching projects.

It's quick at organizing [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at navigating [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at searching [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at writing [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at testing [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at saving [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

It's quick at maintaining [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) code.

*Briefly, alited is totally quick while being still in its embryonic days a pure [Tcl/Tk](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/) application.*

## Inevitable blah-blah

The *alited* project started 1 March 2021 and as such isn't complete, perfect etc. And in no way and in no time it will be so.

In fact, *alited* has been developed by its own means since v0.2. Inspite of permanent overheads of this way and a raw state of *alited*, it turned out to be amazingly productive, more and more in the course of time.

Below is a screenshot of *alited*, just to glance at it:

... and its localized and themed variant:
