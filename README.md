# What's that

The *alited* stands for "a lite editor".

The main features of *alited* are:

  * structured code 
  * easy access to the code
  * born for Tcl/Tk development only

It satisfies most requirements of [Tcl Editors](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/Tcl+Editors), adding its own features.

Edited by *alited* are Tcl/Tk files. The C/C++ code is another target of *alited*, still for *Tcl/Tk development only* all the same.

The *alited* facilitates the development and the maintenance of Tcl/Tk code, particularly because of the [unit tree](https://github.com/aplsimple/alited/releases/download/2.Units_alited-1.0.4/2.Units_alited-1.0.4.mp4) being a sort of documentation.

# Inevitable blah-blah

The *alited* project started 1 March 2021 and as such isn't complete, perfect etc. And in no way and in no time it will be so.

In fact, *alited* has been developed by its own means since v0.2. Inspite of permanent overheads of this way and a raw state of *alited*, it turned out to be amazingly productive, more and more in the course of time.

Below is a screenshot of *alited*, just to glance at it:

... and its localized and themed variant:
