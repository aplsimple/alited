 Here, default values for new projects can be set. When you create
 a new project, its initial options are taken from these defaults:

   - "Skip subdirectories" - if the project directory contains some
     subdirectories which should be ignored (most often, SCM ones like
     ".git"), enter their tail names; separate them with spaces; use
     double quotes if they include spaces;

   - "End of line" - if this field is empty, the EOLs for saved files
     are defined by your platform; but if you have some projects with
     other EOLs, set the field accordingly;

   - "Indentation" is a number of spaces to indent your texts' lines;
     if "Auto detection" is on, a text indentation is defined by its
     first indented line while for a new file it's set by "Indentation"

   - "Unit lines per 1 red bar" is a number of lines to mark a unit
     (proc/method) with 1 red bar in its icon; a fully red icon is bad!

   - "Multi-line strings" is recommended be OFF for projects with large
     files; it's only for granular (with small source files) projects
     that ON value could be a good choice because it can slow your work;
     use it on your own risk.

 If you don't want to use these defaults for new projects, switch the
 top checkbox off. While preparing a new project in "Projects" dialogue,
 you can input its options in the "Options" tab.
