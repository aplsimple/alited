 Here, default values for new projects can be set. When you create
 a new project, its initial options are taken from these defaults:

   - "Skip subdirectories" - if the project directory contains some
     subdirectories which should be ignored (most often, SCM ones like
     ".git"), enter their tail names; separate them with spaces; use
     double quotes if they include spaces;

   - "End of line" - if this field is empty, the EOLs for saved files
     would correspond your platform; but if you have some projects
     with other EOLs, set the field accordingly;

   - "Indentation" is a number of spaces to indent your texts' lines;
     if "Auto detection" is on, a text indentation is calculated from
     its first indented line; for a new file it's set by "Indentation"

   - "Unit lines per 1 red bar" is a number of lines to mark a unit
     (proc/method) with 1 red bar in its icon; a fully red icon is bad!

   - "Multi-line strings" is strongly recommended be OFF; it's only for
     granular (with small source files) projects the ON value could be
     a good choice as it can slow your work; use it on your own risk.

 If you don't want to use these defaults, switch the top checkbox off.
 While preparing a new project in "Projects" dialogue, you would input
 its options in the "Options" tab.
