 This dialogue allows moving the <b>unit descriptions</b> inside or outside
 the leaf units (procs and methods).

 The inside descriptions are just <b>below</b> the unit declarations.
 The outside descriptions are just <b>above</b> the unit declarations.

 The outside descriptions set a problem before the unit tree: when you
 select a unit in the unit tree, the cursor is set on its declaration,
 while you would prefer it being on the head line of its description.

 The problem is solved by <b>Leaf's regexp</b> option of <b>Projects/Options</b>
 defining the head line (<b>"separator"</b>) of units. It will be active
 for the appropriate project.

 Also, you can use the analogue option of <b>Preferences/Units</b> which
 allows using a common <b>Leaf's regexp</b> for all projects.

 Switch the option on and set your preferable regular expression.

 The standard <b>Leaf's regexp</b> defines the head line of units like this:

 <b># =========================== UnitName ==============================</b>
 or
 <b># UnitName ==========================================================</b>

 The <b>N</b> of "Separator" field is a wildcard for the unit name.
 The number in parenthesises <b>(70)</b> means maximum length of separators.

 If your current unit descriptions are not that you want, in this
 dialogue you can move them to the proper place.

 When moving the descriptions inside the units, you can optionally set
 a <b>separator</b> (e.g. #-------) to be placed above the unit declarations.

 If there is no unit processed and <b>ALREADY PROCESSED?</b> displayed, the
 reason may be that <b>alited</b> cannot find the source unit head lines. In
 ideal the unit tree shows <b>leaf units</b> with their descriptions to move.
 Try to change <b>Leaf's regexp</b> settings in Projects and/or Preferences.

 <r>Note</r>: The inside unit descriptions allow using <b>Ruff!</b> doc generator
 (see <link>ruff.magicsplat.com</link>). It's default setting of <b>alited</b> as well.

 There are also doc generators handling the outside unit descriptions.
