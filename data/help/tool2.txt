 <r>Run</r> button runs a selected command. Sort of "run it on fly".
 The command is active all the time when "Run" dialogue is open.
 It's also run with F5 key.

 The dialogue isn't closed with <r>Run</r> button, so that you can
 customize commands before saving them. Also, while "Run" dialogue
 is open, you can modify your scripts (the dialogue is non-modal).

 After customizing all commands, press <r>Save</r> button: it saves
 the dialogue's current settings and closes it.

 <r>Cancel</r> button dismisses all changes made in the dialogue.

 Any Tcl script (file.tcl) can be run <r>in console</r> or <r>in Tkcon</r>.
 Both modes have their pros and contras - mostly pros, if properly used.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 With <r>By command #RUNF</r> you can write comments in a file like this:
   #RUNF: file.tcl arg1 arg2 arg3
 or
   #EXEC: tclsh file.tcl arg1 arg2 arg3
 meaning that "tclsh file.tcl arg1 arg2 arg3" will be run on the file.

 With <r>By command</r> you can set a list of arbitrary commands
 to be selected and run independently on a type of current file.
 It can be an OS command or an executable to be run <r>in console</r>.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 If there isn't <b>#RUNF:</b> nor <b>#EXEC:</b> comment nor <r>By command
 </r>option, a current file is run by an associated application.

 If a Tcl file has to be run, you can set the command with or without
 <b>tclsh</b>, <b>wish</b>, <b>tclkit</b> etc., for example:

   /usr/bin/tclsh /home/me/myPG/src/file.tcl LOG=~/TMP/log.txt
   /home/me/myPG/src/file.tcl LOG=~/TMP/log.txt

 The command can include wildcards:
   <b>%f</b>  - current file's name
   <b>%d</b>  - current file's directory
   <b>%pd</b> - project's directory
   <b>%s</b>  - text's selection / current word
   <b>%H</b>  - home directory
   <b>%%</b>  - %

 <b>The combobox's commands can be created and edited in the text box,
 at that a current line is highlighted and displayed in the combobox.</b>

 These two ways of "Run" (<r>By command #RUNF</r> and
 <r>By command</r>) are useful for two different type of projects:

   <r>By command #RUNF</r> - for <b>heterogeneous projects</b>:

     when a project contains a lot of files that need to
     be tested and debugged with their own commands - then you use
     <r>#RUNF / #EXEC</r> comments in the project's files to test/debug
     them with their appropriate commands

   <r>By command</r> - for <b>monolith projects</b>:

     when you have a list of commands to test and debug the whole of
     your application (<b>alited</b> is an example) - then you use
     <r>By command</r> option to test/debug it with the list

 Anyhow, "Run me" item of <b>e_menu</b> tool allows running a current file
 in "normal" manner by an associated application. Press F4 twice for it.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Also, you can enter commands to be run <r>before</r> running a file.
 It can be necessary <b>for a specific project</b>, sort of initialization.

 These commands can be OS commands or executables, for example:
   cd ~/TMP; rm log.txt
