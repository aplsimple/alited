 <r>Run</r> button runs a selected command. Sort of "run it on fly".
 The command is active all the time when "Run" dialogue is open.
 It's also run with F5 key.

 The dialogue isn't closed with <r>Run</r> button, so that you can
 customize commands before saving them. Also, while "Run" dialogue
 is open, you can modify your scripts (the dialogue is non-modal).

 After customizing all commands, press <r>Save</r> button: it saves
 the dialogue's current settings and closes it.

 <r>Cancel</r> button dismisses all changes made in the dialogue.

 A Tcl script (file.tcl) can be run in <r>console</r> or <r>Tkcon</r>.

 <r>1.</r> You can set a command that is run independently on a type of
 current file. It can be OS command or an executable to run in console.

 If a Tcl file has to be run, you can set the command with or without
 <b>tclsh</b>, <b>wish</b>, <b>tclkit</b> etc., for example:

   /usr/bin/tclsh /home/me/myPG/src/file.tcl LOG=~/TMP/log.txt
   /home/me/myPG/src/file.tcl LOG=~/TMP/log.txt

 The command can include wildcards:
   <b>%f</b>  - current file's name
   <b>%d</b>  - current file's directory
   <b>%pd</b> - project's directory
   <b>%s</b>  - text's selection / current word
   <b>%%</b>  - %

 The combobox's commands can be created and edited in the text box,
 at that a current line is highlighted and displayed in the combobox.

 <r>2.</r> For <b>By command #RUNF:</b> you write comments in a file, like:
   #RUNF: file.tcl arg1 arg2 arg3
 meaning that <b>tclsh file.tcl arg1 arg2 arg3</b> will be run on the file.

 These two ways are useful for two different type of projects:
   - <b>monolith</b>: you have a lot of files that need few commands to test
     and debug the whole application (<b>alited</b> is an example)
   - <b>heterogeneous</b>: a project contains a lot of files that need to
     be tested and debugged with their own commands

 <r>3.</r> "Run me" item of <b>e_menu</b> tool allows running a current file
 in "normal" manner by an associated application. Press F4 twice for it.

 <r>4.</r> You can enter commands to be run before running a current file.
 It can be necessary <b>for a specific project</b>, sort of initialization.

 These commands can be OS commands or executables, for example:
   cd ~/TMP; rm log.txt
