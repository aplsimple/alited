 You can enter commands to be run before running a current file with
 <r>Run</r> tool.

 These commands can be Tcl commands or executables, e.g.
    cd ~/TMP
    rm log.txt

 It can be necessary <b>for a specific project</b>.
 Something like an initialization before <b>Run</b>.

 Also, you can set a command that will be run "forcedly", <b>independently
 on the type</b> of currently edited file. Very good for those use cases
 when you have to edit a lot of <b>non-Tcl texts</b> and see them in work.

 The command can be any executable file available at your machine.
 It's run in console. Hit <r>Run</r> to test it, <r>Delete</r> to remove it.

 If it's a Tcl file that has to be run, you can set the command with or
 without <b>tclsh</b>, <b>wish</b>, <b>tclkit</b> etc., for example:

    /usr/bin/tclsh /home/me/myPG/src/myPG.tcl LOG=~/TMP/log.txt
    /home/me/myPG/src/myPG.tcl LOG=~/TMP/log.txt

 The command can include wildcards:
   <b>%f</b>  - current file's name
   <b>%d</b>  - current file's directory
   <b>%pd</b> - project's directory

 <r>Note:</r> clear this command to return to "normal" mode of <b>Run</b>.

 Anyhow, "Run me" of <b>e_menu</b> tool allows you to run a current file in
 its "normal" mode by its associated application. Press F4 twice for this.
