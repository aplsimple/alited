 At the very first start, alited offers some simple initial actions.

 Namely: you are offered to choose a configuration directory where
 alited will store its settings.

 The default directory is probably the best choice if you don't plan
 to have several <b>types of projects</b> at your machine.

 When you use the default directory, you may not pass it to alited as
 its first argument.

 On the other hand, if you choose some other configuration directory,
 this directory's name may be passed to alited as its <b>first argument</b>.

 You can have several copies of your configuration directories, e.g.
 ~/.config1, ~/.config2 etc. each of them customized for its own
 <b>type of projects</b>: public/private, for work/fun and so on.

 For example, you can develop some fun projects with "Florid" color
 scheme and a funny font for editing. Or hobby projects with other
 settings. At last, work projects with "tough-stuff" settings:)

 Anyhow, alited shows you where it will store its settings,
 so that you can <b>backup</b> them along with other programs' ones.
