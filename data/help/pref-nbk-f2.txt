 Switch "Confirm exit" on to secure alited against an unintended quit,
 i.e. at clicking [x] button or pressing Alt+F4.

 You can save a current alited configuration on:
   - opening a file
   - closing a file
   - saving a file

 The last option can work together with the option
   "Save before bar/menu runs"
 which means saving file(s) at running a bar/menu action.

 See also "Preferences / Tools / bar/menu" tab.

 The following options restrict a number of:
   - files in 'Files/Recent Files' menu item
   - items in 'Last Visited' list of units
   - project files: this is important in order to
     secure against choosing a giant directory
     (like /home) for a project

 The "Back up files..." option allows to save a file's original version
 just before its change, in a project's subdirectory hidden for SCM. Set
 it blank to disable the backup. The "Maximum" field allows to backup a
 few of file copies, named like: file-1.bak, file-2.bak, file-3.bak...
