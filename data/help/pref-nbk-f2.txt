 When empty, <b>Port to listen alited</b> option allows multiple aliteds
 working simultaneously. Otherwise, alited would listen the chosen port
 and arise (with passed file names) when you try to start it again.

 Switch <b>Confirm exit</b> ON to avoid an unintended exit of alited,
 i.e. at clicking [x] button or pressing Alt+F4.

 You can <b>save a current alited configuration</b> on:
   - opening a file
   - closing a file
   - saving a file

 This option works together with the option (highly recommended "All"):
   <b>Save before bar/menu runs</b>
 which means saving file(s) at running a bar/menu action.
 See also "Preferences / Tools / bar/menu" tab.

 <b>Other options</b> restrict a number of:
   - files in 'Files/Recent Files' menu item
   - items in 'Last Visited' list of units
   - project files: this is important in order to
     secure against choosing a giant directory
     (like /home) for a project

 The <b>Back up files</b> option allows to save a file's original version
 just before its change, in a project's subdirectory hidden for SCM. Set
 it blank to disable the backup. The "Maximum" field allows to backup a
 few of file copies, named like: file-1.bak, file-2.bak, file-3.bak...

 <b>Bell at warnings</b> may be set off to make 'alited' mute at warnings.
