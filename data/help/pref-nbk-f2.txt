 Switch "Confirm exit" on to secure alited against
 an unintended quit, i.e. at clicking [x] button or
 pressing Ctrl+F4.

 You may wish to save alited's configuration on:
   - opening a file
   - closing a file
   - saving a file

 The last option can work along with the option
   "Save before bar/menu runs"
 which means that at running a bar/menu action
 the current or all files can be saved.

 See also "Preferences/Tools/bar/menu" settings.

 Other options restrict a number of:

   - files in 'Files/Recent Files' menu item

   - items in 'Last Visited' list of units

   - project files: this is important in order to
     secure against choosing a giant directory
     (like /home) for a project
