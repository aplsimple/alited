 Use drop-down list to select End-of-Line for your texts.
 "LF" fits Linux, "CR" - Mac, "CRLF" - Windows. The empty
 value means "auto".

 The alited application provides a space indentation only.
 No "smart", "auto", "tab replacements" etc.

 Select the indentation length for your projects.

 The "multiline strings" option should be set carefully.
 Its "on" value would highlight all Tcl strings properly,
 including the multi-line ones.

 However, its "on" value is NOT recommended for large files
 or/and poor hardware, because it would drasticly slow the
 editing.

 On the other hand, having granular projects with a lot of
 small Tcl modules, you can try and switch this option on.

 Also note that using "\" as string continuations and "\\n"
 as line cutters you can easily avoid issues with multiline
 strings, even with the "multiline strings" option off.
