 If it is empty, "Port to listen alited" option allows multiple aliteds
 working simultaneously. Otherwise, alited would listen the chosen port
 and arise (with passed file names) when you try to start it again.

 Switch "Confirm exit" on to secure alited against an unintended quit,
 i.e. at clicking [x] button or pressing Alt+F4.

 You can save a current alited configuration on:
   - opening a file
   - closing a file
   - saving a file

 This option works together with the option (highly recommended "All"!):
   "Save before bar/menu runs"
 which means saving file(s) at running a bar/menu action.

 See also "Preferences / Tools / bar/menu" tab.

 Other options restrict a number of:
   - files in 'Files/Recent Files' menu item
   - items in 'Last Visited' list of units
   - project files: this is important in order to
     secure against choosing a giant directory
     (like /home) for a project

 The "Back up files..." option allows to save a file's original version
 just before its change, in a project's subdirectory hidden for SCM. Set
 it blank to disable the backup. The "Maximum" field allows to backup a
 few of file copies, named like: file-1.bak, file-2.bak, file-3.bak...

 "Bell at warnings" may be set off to make 'alited' mute at warnings.
