 The <r>Project printer</r> tool allows creating a "hard copy" of
 the project.

 The <b>hard copy</b> is a set of .html files that are created from
 selected project files in the chosen <r>Output directory</r>.

 The <r>Markdown processor</r> is used to include Readme, README,
 Readme.md, README.md (and so on) files into the .html files.

 It's highly recommended to install and use the <b>pandoc</b>
 application available at:
   <link>github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases</link>

 The <b>alited</b>'s own markdown processor can be used for the very
 basic markdown documents like <b>alited</b>'s README.md which is
 nevertheless quite enough for most of projects.

 If you enter other markdown command, use in it <b>%i</b> wildcard
 for the source README and <b>%o</b> for a target (temporary) file.

 The <r>color fields</r> and <r>width of contents</r> affect the appearance
 of the resulting .html files.

 The <b>file tree</b> allows selecting the files for the resulting
 hard copy. To select files, use the tools above the file
 tree. Or <b>Space</b> key.

 The <b>hard copy</b> can be printed by means of a browser.

 The <r>Final processor</r> means a command to process the resulting
 <b>hard copy</b>, e.g. to embed it in a reference guide or just to
 browse the <b>output directory</b> (use <b>%D</b> wildcard for its name).
