 <r>alited</r> is a multilingual program and as such it provides
 a translation facility (for example, to add new .msg files to
 <b>alited/data/msgs</b> of alited's source :)

 The translation is available for a specific type of files, i.e.
 having the extension <b>.l1-l2</b> which means translating from
 <b>l1</b> language to <b>l2</b> language.

 Also <b>l2.msg</b> files can be translated from English to <b>l2</b>.

 For example:
   <b>*.en-de</b> files are for English-Deutsch translations
   <b>ru.msg</b> files are for English-Russian translations

 You need an access to <r>Internet</r> to translate the files.

 How it works? When you open/create this type of file, you run the line
 by line translation with just pressing F5 key (of <b>Tools/Run</b>)
 while the caret is set on the appropriate lines.

 So, after entering a line, press F5 key and after a pause you'll get
 the translation of the line. The response time doesn't depend greatly
 on the length of the line, so that you can compose a rather lengthy
 line and then press F5 on it.

 Though, there is a limit of translation length. On September 2023 it is
 1000 characters. The current line's length is seen in the "Col:" field
 of alited's status bar. If a line is too long, split it with Enter key
 and translate its parts.

 The slowness of the translation is a cost of its "freedomness". After
 acquiring API key of LibreTranslate, you'll get the quick translation
 as well. At that <b>lib/addon/hl_trans.tcl</b> should be modified.
 The alited's author will be grateful to you for this modification.

 The translation options can be customized in "Preferences":
 <b>Preferences / Editor / Plain text</b>.

 Note that <b>l1</b> and <b>l2</b> are the language (not country) codes.
 E.g. <b>uk</b> means Ukrainian language, not United Kingdom country.
