 Options of the project:

   - "Skip subdirectories" - if the project directory contains some
     subdirectories which should be ignored (most often, SCM ones like
     ".git"), enter their tail names; separate them with spaces; use
     double quotes if they include spaces;

   - "End of line" - if this field is empty, the EOLs for saved files
     are defined by your platform; but if you have some projects with
     other EOLs, set the field accordingly;

   - "Indentation" is a number of spaces to indent your texts' lines;
     if "Auto detection" is on, a text indentation is defined by its
     first indented line while for a new file it's set by "Indentation"

   - "Unit lines per 1 red bar" is a number of lines to mark a unit
     (proc/method) with 1 red bar in its icon; a fully red icon is bad!

   - "Multi-line strings" is recommended be OFF for projects with large
     files; it's only for granular (with small source files) projects
     that ON value could be a good choice because it can slow your work;
     use it on your own risk.

   - "Remove trailing whitespaces" - if this option is on, the trailing
     whitespaces of all texts' lines are removed at saving. Otherwise,
     "Edit" menu item can be used to do this for a current text.

 NOTE: for new projects (if this mode is checked), these options may be
 defined by "Preferences/General/Projects".

 In the list of files, you can select file(s) with left-click, then use
 right-click to invoke the context menu and open/close the files in the
 current session.
