 Options of the project:

   - <b>Skip subdirectories</b> - if the project directory contains some
     subdirectories which should be ignored (most often, SCM ones like
     ".git"), enter their tail names; separate them with spaces; use
     double quotes if they include spaces.

   - <b>End of line</b> - if this field is empty, the EOLs for saved files
     are defined by your platform; but if you have some projects with
     other EOLs, set the field accordingly.

   - <b>Indentation</b> is a number of spaces to indent your texts' lines;
     if "Auto detection" is on, a text indentation is defined by its
     first indented line while for a new file it's set by this option.
     This options sets also <b>Tab character</b>'s length, if you mapped
     the default completion to an other key instead of Tab.

   - <b>Unit lines per 1 red bar</b> is a number of lines to mark
     proc/method with 1 red bar in the unit tree; the fully red is bad!

   - <b>Multi-line strings</b> is recommended to be OFF for projects with
     large files; it's only for granular (with small scripts) projects
     that ON value can be a good choice because it can slow your work;
     use it on your own risk. Anyhow, \\n and \ characters create the
     multiple lines of strings in nice way too.

   - <b>Remove trailing whitespaces</b> - if set ON, the trailing
     whitespaces of all texts' lines are removed at saving. Otherwise,
     "Edit" menu item can be used to do this for a current text.
