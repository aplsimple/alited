 In the <b>Plain texts' extensions</b> field, you can set additional extensions
 for the plain text files you use (for example, .rc).

 Enter the extensions separated by spaces.

 The <b>Translation link</b> means a link to the translation service used in
 <b>.l1-l2</b> type of files where <b>l1</b> and <b>l2</b> are the language codes.

 Also <b>l2.msg</b> files can be translated from English to <b>l2</b>.

 For example:
   <b>*.en-de</b> files are for English-Deutsch translations
   <b>ru.msg</b> files are for English-Russian translations

 When you open/create this type file, you run the line by line
 translation with just pressing F5 key (of <b>Tools/Run</b>) while the caret
 is set on an appropriate line.

 The <b>Adding translations</b> switch selects a mode of handling translations:
   - if ON,  the translated line is inserted after the original line
   - if OFF, the translated line replaces the original line

 Use <b>Default</b> button to restore the default setting.
