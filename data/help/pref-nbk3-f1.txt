 Fill the following fields to handle the units:

 <b>Branch's regexp</b> - a comment that defines a branch's beginning
 <b>Proc's regexp</b> - a regexp that defines a proc's (method's) beginning

 <b>Check branch's regexp</b> - a regexp by which a branch change is detected
 <b>Check proc's regexp</b> - a regexp by which a proc change is detected
 At modifying a line, these REs decide have the unit tree to be updated.

 <b>Use leaf's regexp</b> - allows an additional regexp for leaves
 <b>Leaf's regexp</b> - an additional regexp for leaves

 <b>Untouched top lines</b> - a number of lines untouched by unit moves

 The additional leaf's regexp is useful when you use the header comments
 before proc/method declaration. By default alited checks for the header
 comments below a proc/method declaration.

 Use <b>Default</b> button to set default settings.
