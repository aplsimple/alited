 Fill the following fields to handle the units:
 
 "Branch's regexp" - a comment that defines a branch's beginning
 "Proc's regexp" - a comment that defines a proc's (method's) beginning

 "Check branch's regexp" - a regexp by which a branch change is detected
 "Check proc's regexp" - a regexp by which a proc change is detected

 "Use leaf's regexp" - allows an additional regexp for leaves
 "Leaf's regexp" - an additional regexp for leaves
 
 "Untouched top lines" - a number of lines untouched by unit moves

 The additional leaf's regexp is useful when you use the header comments
 before proc/method declaration. By default alited checks for the header
 comments below a proc/method declaration.
