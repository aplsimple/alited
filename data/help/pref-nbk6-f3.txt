 You can add new items to the toolbar and "Tools" menu.

 The items' lines contain the following:

   [+] and [x] buttons to insert or delete a line

   "separator" checkbox for a separator of toolbar/menu

   "icons" list to set an icon of command

   "button" to select e_menu's command

 If you want an item be present in the toolbar, select
 an icon for it. If the item should be in the "Tools"
 menu only, leave the icon blank or select "none" icon.

 Press a right button to select a command of e_menu.

 While selecting a command from e_menu, use Escape key
 or popup menu's Exit to cancel the selection.
