 You can add new items to the <r>toolbar</r> and <r>Tools</r> menu.

 An item contains:

   <b>icons list</b> to set an icon of command

   <b>button</b> to choose <b>e_menu</b>'s command

 An empty item stands for a <b>separator</b> of toolbar/menu.

 If you want an item be present in the <r>toolbar</r>, select an icon for it.
 If the item should be in <r>Tools</r> menu only, leave the icon blank or select
 <b>none</b> icon.

 Hit a <b>right button</b> to choose a command of <b>e_menu</b>. At that, to select
 a whole menu, right click on its item and choose "Select" from a popup menu.

 While choosing a command from <b>e_menu</b>, use Escape key or popup menu's "Exit"
 to quit <b>e_menu</b>.

 To make a new item, use one of 3 empty items at the bottom (there are
 only 3 of them for a session, but the total is 32). Use also:

   <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> buttons to move items up/down

   <b>[x]</b> button to delete items

 Use a scrollbar at the right edge of the dialogue to view the bottom of
 the list. Or resize the dialogue's window for this.
