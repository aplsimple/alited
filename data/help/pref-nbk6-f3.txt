 You can add new items to the toolbar and "Tools" menu.

 An item contains:

   <b>separator</b> checkbox for a separator of toolbar/menu

   <b>icons</b> list to set an icon of command

   <b>button</b> to choose e_menu's command

 If you want an item be present in the toolbar, select an icon for it.
 If the item should be in "Tools" menu only, leave the icon blank or select
 <b>none</b> icon.

 Hit a <b>right button</b> to choose a command of e_menu. At that, to select
 a whole menu, right click on its item and choose "Select" from a popup menu.

 While choosing a command from e_menu, use Escape key or popup menu's "Exit"
 to quit e_menu.

 Clicking a separator checkbutton, you can save/restore its item.

 To make a new item, choose one of 3 empty items at the bottom (there are
 only 3 of them for a session, but the total is 32). Use also:

   <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> buttons to move items up/down

   <b>[x]</b> button to delete items

 Use a scrollbar at the right edge of the dialogue to view the bottom of
 the list. Or resize the dialogue's window for this.
