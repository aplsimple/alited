 You can add new items to the toolbar and "Tools" menu.

 The item lines contain the following:

   [+] and [x] buttons to insert or delete a line

   "separator" checkbox for a separator of toolbar/menu

   "icons" list to set an icon of command

   "button" to choose e_menu's command

 If you want an item be present in the toolbar, select
 an icon for it. If the item should be in the "Tools"
 menu only, leave the icon blank or select "none" icon.

 Hit a right button to choose a command of e_menu.

 To choose a whole menu, right click on its e_menu item
 and choose "Select" from the popup menu.

 While choosing a command from e_menu, use Escape key
 or popup menu's "Exit" to quit the e_menu.

 Use a scrollbar at the right edge of the dialogue to
 scroll to the bottom of the list. Or resize the
 dialogue's window for this.
