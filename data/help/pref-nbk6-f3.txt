 You can add new items to the toolbar and "Tools" menu.

 The item lines contain the following:

   [+] and [x] buttons to insert or delete a line

   "separator" checkbox for a separator of toolbar/menu

   "icons" list to set an icon of command

   "button" to choose e_menu's command

 If you want an item be present in the toolbar, select an icon for it.
 If the item should be in the "Tools" menu only, leave the icon blank
 or select "none" icon.

 Hit a right button to choose a command of e_menu. Then, to select a
 whole menu, right click on it and choose "Select" from a popup menu.

 While choosing a command from e_menu, use Escape key or popup menu's
 "Exit" to quit e_menu.

 Use a scrollbar at the right edge of the dialogue to scroll to the
 bottom of the list. Or resize the dialogue's window for this.
