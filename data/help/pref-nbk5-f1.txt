 Use drop-down comboboxes to select a key combination for appropriate
 operations.

 Some key combinations may not work, so that you might prefer some
 key groups to others.

 For example, <r>Alt+</r>A/B/C... would work highly likely always.

 Some key combinations can be not accessible due to their use by OS.

 In Linux, for example, <b>Ctrl+F5</b> may be used to switch to 5th desktop,
 so that if you don't have the 5th desktop and want <b>Ctrl+F5</b> be
 used in alited, just clear this OS setting.
