 Use drop-down lists to select a <b>theme</b> and a <b>color scheme</b>.

 Note that "default", "clam", "alt", "classic" are standard Ttk themes.
 The standard themes may be used with all color schemes.

 But "aw*", "azure", "sun-valley", "forest" light / dark themes are only good
 with light / dark color schemes accordingly.

 E.g. "azure-dark" theme fits to "AzureDark" color scheme, while "forest-light"
 is best viewed with "ForestLight" color scheme, "awdark" with "AwDark" or even
 "SunValleyDeep", "MildDark", "Quiverly" etc. The main point is "dark for dark,
 light for light".

 You can tint the colors with <b>Tint</b> option. The negative values mean
 "darker", the positive values mean "lighter".
