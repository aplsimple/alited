 Use drop-down lists to select a <b>theme</b> and a <b>color scheme</b>.

 Note that "default", "clam", "alt", "classic" are standard Ttk themes.
 The standard themes may be used with all color schemes.

 But "aw*", "azure", "sun-valley", "forest" light / dark themes are only good
 with light / dark color schemes accordingly.

 E.g. "azure-dark" theme fits to "AzureDark" color scheme, while "forest-light"
 is best viewed with "ForestLight" color scheme, "awdark" - with "Darcula" or
 "Dusk" or "MildDark" etc. The main point is "dark for dark, light for light".

 For "default", "clam", "alt", "classic" and "aw*" themes: you can tint their
 colors with <b>Tint</b> option. The negative values mean "darker", the positive
 values mean "lighter". These themes are most recommended for their stability.
