 Use drop-down lists to select a theme and a color scheme.

 Note that "default", "clam", "alt", "classic" are standard Ttk themes.
 The standard themes may be used with all color schemes.

 But "aw", "azure", "sun-valley", "forest" light / dark themes are only good
 with light / dark color schemes accordingly.

 E.g. "azure-dark" theme fits to "AzureDark" color scheme, while "forest-light"
 is best viewed with "ForestLight" color scheme, "awdark" - with "Darcula" or
 "Dusk" or "MildDark" etc. The main point is "dark for dark, light for light".

 For "default", "clam", "alt", "classic" and "aw*" themes: you can tint their
 colors with "Tint" option. The negative values mean "darker", the positive
 values mean "lighter". These themes are most recommended for their stability.

 The "Preferable locale" is mostly a country code, for example: ru, ua, cz, en.

 The "Font" field allows to override Tcl/Tk default font for labels, menus etc.

 Additionally, you can set font sizes that will touch the following widgets:
 - small font : trees, tabs, tooltips, info & status bar, find/replace dialogue
 - middle font: labels, menus, buttons, entries

 The Notes field includes arbitrary ideas, todos etc. for all projects. The
