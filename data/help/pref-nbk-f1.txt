 Use drop-down list to select a color scheme.

 To tint the scheme's colors, change the "Tint".
 The negative values mean "darker", the positive
 values mean "lighter".

 E.g. you might try the themes and the tints:
   "15: African1" and -10
   "24: Dark" and 10

 The font sizes will touch the following widgets:
 - small font : lists, tabs, info and status bars
 - middle font: menus, labels

 The Notes field includes arbitrary ideas, todos
 etc. for all projects. The projects are supplied
 with their own notes in "Setup/Projects".
