 These regular expressions (RE2) allows to apply additional
 filters to the found strings.

 The RE2 are set in the separate lines of two text fields:

 <r>Including RE2:</r>
   If any of its RE will prove true, the found string
   will be in the search result.

 <r>Excluding RE2:</r>
   If any of its RE will prove true, the found string
   will <b>not</b> be in the search result.

 For example, with the main RE as
   <b>(^|[^:]){7}\m\w+::</b>
 and excluding RE2 as
    <b>\s*proc\s+
    \s*method\s+
    (\[|\{|"|;)\s*\m\w+::</b>
 we can search the uses of non-absolute names of variables
 (at least, excluding declarations and calls of commands)
 which is good at moving from Tcl/Tk 8.6 to Tcl/Tk 9.0.

 If a RE2 line consists of asterisks only (e.g. <b>***</b>),
 the rest are skipped at filtering. Just to save useful RE2.

 If a RE2 line begins with asteriks and continues with other
 characters, it's skipped at filtering (e.g. <b>*\s*proc\s+</b>).

 To <r>enable / disable</r> RE2, click the appropriate checkbox.
