 Try and use buttons under the list to add/change/delete a project.

 Try and enter a short name of project, avoiding special characters.

 Try and choose a root directory of the project. Supposedly, it should
 contain all files and subdirectories of the project.

 If the project directory contains some subdirectories which should be
 ignored (most often, SCM ones like ".git"), enter their tail names.
 Separate them with spaces. Use double quotes if they include spaces.

 The "Notes" field may be used as a sort of diary for the project.

 The "Options" tab contains other details of the project:

   - "End of line" - if this field is empty, the EOL for texts would
     correspond your platform; but if you have some projects with
     other EOLs, set the field accordingly;

   - "Indentation" is a number of spaces to indent your texts' lines;

   - "Unit lines per 1 red bar" is a number of lines to mark a unit
     (proc/method) with 1 red bar in its icon; a fully red icon is bad!

   - "Multi-line strings" is strongly recommended be OFF; it's only for
     granular (with small source files) projects the ON value could be
     a good choice as it can slow your work; use it on your own risk.

 At adding / changing a project, you can choose to include the current
 files into it. Other choices are "replace", "clear" and "don't change".
