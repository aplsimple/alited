 For a new project, enter its name avoiding special characters.
 Then choose a root directory of the project. Supposedly, it should
 contain all files and subdirectories of the project.

 The buttons under the list are used to <b>add/change/delete</b> a project.

 Use <r>Add</r> and <r>Change</r> buttons after filling project's data.

 The <b>Notes</b> field may be used as a sort of diary for the project.
 Also, you can keep a list of TODOs in <b>Notes</b>.
 __________________________________________________________________________

 The calendar and the text below are used to set deadlines of the TODOs.
 It's very useful, especially for projects developed unsteadily!
 Actually, any idea that occurs to you, is welcome to this calendar helper.

 To set a deadline:
   - select a day in the calendar
   - enter a text (reminder) of TODO
   - use buttons to <b>erase/paste/undo/redo</b> the text

 When the present day reaches a deadline, its TODO is highlighted and the
 bell rings, to remind of the TODO.

 If the TODO is done, just erase it with <r>Erase</r> button.

 Or click <r>Select</r> button if you want to continue with doing the TODO.
