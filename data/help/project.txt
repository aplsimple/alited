 For a new project, enter its name avoiding special characters.
 Then choose a root directory of the project. Supposedly, it should
 contain all files and subdirectories of the project.

 If the project directory contains some subdirectories which should be
 ignored (most often, SCM ones like ".git"), enter their tail names.
 Separate them with spaces. Use double quotes if they include spaces.

 The "Notes" field may be used as a sort of diary for the project.

 The "Options" tab contains other details of the project:

   - "End of line" - if this field is empty, the EOLs for saved files
     would correspond your platform; but if you have some projects
     with other EOLs, set the field accordingly;

   - "Indentation" is a number of spaces to indent your texts' lines;
     if "Auto detection" is on, a text indentation is calculated from
     its first indented line; for a new file it's set by "Indentation"

   - "Unit lines per 1 red bar" is a number of lines to mark a unit
     (proc/method) with 1 red bar in its icon; a fully red icon is bad!

   - "Multi-line strings" is recommended be OFF for projects with giant
     files; it's only for granular (with small source files) projects
     the ON value could be a good choice because it can slow your work;
     use it on your own risk.

 The buttons under the list are used to add / change / delete a project.
 At adding / changing a project, you can choose to include the current
 files into it. Other choices are "replace", "clear" and "don't change".
