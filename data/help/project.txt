 For a new project, enter its name avoiding special characters.
 Then choose a root directory of the project. Supposedly, it should
 contain all files and subdirectories of the project.

 The buttons under the list are used to <bold>add/change/delete</bold> a project.

 Use <bold><red>"Add" and "Change" buttons</red></bold> after filling project's data.

 The "Notes" field may be used as a sort of diary for the project.
 Also, you can keep a list of TODOs in "Notes" and allocate them
 to days of the calendar.

 The calendar and the text below are used to set deadlines of TODO.
 It's very useful, esp. for projects developed unsteadily.

 To set a deadline:
   - select a day in the calendar
   - enter a text (reminder) of TODO
   - use buttons to <bold>erase/paste/undo/redo</bold> the text

 When the present day reaches a deadline, its TODO is highlighted
 and the bell rings, to remind of the TODO. If the TODO is done,
 just erase it with <red><bold>"Erase" button</red></bold>. Or click <red><bold>"Select" button</red></bold> if
 you want to continue with doing the TODO.
