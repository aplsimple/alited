 The alited editor is Tcl / unit / project oriented.
 _______________________________________________________________________

 Use the unit tree.
 Use the list of favorite units.
 Use the list of last visited units.

 Their intensive use will facilitate a navigation throughout a code.

 To populate a unit tree, use Shift+F1 / +F2 / +F3 keys which insert
 a stub for a branch title. Just enter it at the cursor's position.

 Insert your units in proper places of code. Use F11/F12 to move them.
 Ctrl+click on the unit tree to select several units for the moving.

 The project orientation means that you probably can't do it without
 a project while working in the alited. The alited isn't designed to
 be a general purpose editor. It's not passed a "file name" argument.

 If you develop or maintain several projects (esp. related ones), the
 "Setup/Project" menu item will for sure become your favorite.

 Use the list of favorites' lists to solve their appropriate tasks
 inside a project. Thus, you would have subprojects inside a project.

 with its appropriate list of hot keys.

 The alited dialogues provide "Help" button for a context help.
