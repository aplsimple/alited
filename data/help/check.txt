 This tool checks Tcl files (.tcl, .tm, .msg) for consistency of {}, [], ()
 and "". Results are shown in the <b>info bar</b>.

 Also, the files are checked for duplicate unit names.

 The results contain general info about a file and specific data on its
 <b>leaves</b> (procedures and methods). The <b>branches</b> are not checked.

 The <b>file results</b> cover the whole file. There might be inconsistencies
 in some specific leaves and seemingly good results for the file as whole.

 The file results include <b>(a/b/c/d)</b> data meaning inconsistencies found
 for {}, [], () and "".

 Click on a result <b>to enter</b> the appropriate file/unit.

 An inconsistency for {} may occur when some procedure declares a procedure
 inside itself. Or if a procedure is located at edges of a namespace or a
 class - in such cases the unit may include its finishing braces.

 To get rid of these "inconsistencies" you can insert branches named like
 "End of class/NS so and so".

 Also, there may be shown inconsistencies of "", when the double quotes
 are used in regular expressions.

 To overcome these false inconsistencies, you can use special comments
 meaning "this unit is checked and proved normal":
    <b># alited_checked</b>

 <r>Note</r>: The checking for consistencies is executed for a current
 proc / method before <b>Run the file</b> tool automatically!
