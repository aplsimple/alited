 This tool checks Tcl files only (.tcl, .tm, .msg).

 The results contain general info about a file and
 specific data on its units (procedures and methods).

 The file results cover the whole of the file. There
 might be inconsistencies in some specific units and
 seemingly "good" results for the file as whole.

 The file results include (x/y/z) info meaning
 inconsistencies for {}, [] and ().

 The inconsistencies for {} occur most often when
 some procedure declares a procedure inside itself.
 Or when a procedure is located at edges of a class
 or a namespace - in such cases the unit may include
 the starting/finishing braces.

 To get rid of these "inconsistencies" you can insert
 branches named like "End of class/NS so and so". Or
 just take these artifacts "as is".

 Click on a result to enter the appropriate file/unit.
