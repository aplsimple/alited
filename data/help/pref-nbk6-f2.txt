 The <b>e_menu</b> main options are following:

 - <b>Run as external app</b> - if it's set ON runs e_menu as an external app;
   this is a bit slower than "internal one", still more secure and themed
   by "Color scheme"; also when running it external you wouldn't await for
   time-wasting actions like backups

 - <b>Color scheme</b> is used when the e_menu is run as an external app

 - <b>Geometry</b> sets a geometry of the main menu at starting e_menu;
   defined as <b>+X+Y</b> meaning x- and y-coordinates

 - <b>Directory of menus</b> contains .mnu files to be used by e_menu

 - <b>Main menu</b> is a menu file to be shown at starting e_menu

 - <b>Projects (%PD wildcard)</b> refers to a file containing "e_menu
   projects": directories to be chosen in "Project..." dialogue;
   many menu items use the chosen directory as %PD wildcard

 Use <b>Default</b> button to set default options of e_menu.

 Use <b>Test</b> button to test these options.
