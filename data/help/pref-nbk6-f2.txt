 The <b>e_menu</b> main options are following:

 - <b>Run as external app</b> - if it's set ON runs e_menu as an external app; this is
   a bit slower than internal e_menu, still <b>more secure</b> and themed by "Color scheme";
   also when running it external you wouldn't await for time-wasting actions like backups.

   Though you might prefer the internal e_menu for its responsive nature including its
   saved geometry.

 - <b>Color scheme</b> is used when the e_menu is run as an external app

 - <b>Geometry</b> sets a geometry of the main menu at starting e_menu;
   you can define it as simply as <b>+X+Y</b> meaning x- and y-coordinates;
   the current geometry of e_menu can be seen in "Project" of its context menu

 - <b>Directory of menus</b> contains .mnu files to be used by e_menu

 - <b>Main menu</b> is a menu file to be shown at starting e_menu

 - <b>Projects (%PD wildcard)</b> refers to a file containing directories to be chosen in
   "Project" dialogue; menu items use %PD wildcard as a project directory

 Use <b>Default</b> button to set default options of e_menu.

 Use <b>Test</b> button to test these options.
