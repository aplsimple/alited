 The e_menu main options are following:

 - "Directory of menus" contains .mnu files to be used by e_menu

 - "Main menu" is a menu file to be shown at starting e_menu

 - "Projects (%PD wildcard)" refers to a file containing "e_menu
   projects": directories to be chosen in "Project..." dialogue;
   many menu items use the chosen directory as %PD wildcard

 - "Save files before run" may be useful for some menu items (e.g.
   for SCM commands) as well as by motives of security; the empty
   field means "no saving"

 - "Linux terminal" is for Linux platforms only, fill this field
   with "xterm" (or "lxterminal") command and its options

 - "Path to man/tcl8.6" is used at calling Tcl/Tk context help;
   the help contents can be downloaded with the command:
    wget -r -k -l 2 -p --accept-regex=.+/man/tcl8\.6.+ \
      https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/

 - "Geometry" sets a geometry of the main menu at starting e_menu

 - "Color scheme" is used when the e_menu is run as external app

 - "Run as external app" if on runs e_menu as external application;
   this is a bit slower than "internal one", still more secure and
   themed by "Color scheme"
