The e_menu main options are following:

 - "Run as external app" if on runs e_menu as external application;
   this is a bit slower than "internal one", still more secure and
   themed by "Color scheme"; also running it external you wouldn't
   await for time-wasting actions like a backup

 - "Color scheme" is used when the e_menu is run as external app

 - "Geometry" sets a geometry of the main menu at starting e_menu

 - "Directory of menus" contains .mnu files to be used by e_menu

 - "Main menu" is a menu file to be shown at starting e_menu

 - "Projects (%PD wildcard)" refers to a file containing "e_menu
   projects": directories to be chosen in "Project..." dialogue;
   many menu items use the chosen directory as %PD wildcard
