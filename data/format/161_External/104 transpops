# The mode=4 means that external command(s) will be applied to a selected text
# or the lines of selected text or, if there is no selection, to a current line.
#
# The selection (or lines of selection) is saved to a temporary file
# that is processed by commands.
#
# The following wildcards (case insensitive) can be used:
#   %S - file name for saved selection
#   %L - file name for saved lines of selection
#   %H - home directory
#   %P - directory of current project
#   %F - current file name
#   %D - directory of current file
#   %A - directory of alited
#   %E - Tcl/Tk executable as set in Preferences/Tools (or one executing alited)
#
# The commands can be formed as follows:
#   Unix = "command" arguments
#   Linux = "command" arguments
#   Windows = "command" arguments
#   Command = "command" arguments
#
# There may be several commands executed one by one.
#
# The command types may be mixed in one configuration file, at that:
# - if the current platform is Unix, then "Unix / Linux" command(s) will be executed only
# - if the current platform is Windows, then "Windows" command(s) will be executed only
# - if the current platform isn't Unix nor Windows or no Unix/Linux/Windows commands set,
#   then "Command" command(s) will be executed only

# ===========================================================================
#
# This configuration file runs the lines of selection as Tcl code.
#
# This runs transpops.tcl to test the selected transpops message.
