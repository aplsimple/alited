# The mode=3 means that command(s) will be applied to a list of lines
# that are selected.
#
# The lines may be selected partly, e.g. from 7th column of first line
# through other lines to 7th column of last line.
#
# The typical case of mode=3 is the sorting lines.
#
# In the command, %v wildcard stands for "list of selected lines".
#
# After applying the command to the list, its result will replace
# the processed lines in the text.

# ==============================================================================
#
# SqueezeLines squeezes multiple spaces to one space (except for leading spaces)
# and removes tailing spaces, e.g. "   a  b   c " => "   a b c".
